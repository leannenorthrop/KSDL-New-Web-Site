/*******************************************************************************
 * Every Theme must have a screen.css file which _may_ be used to import other
 * stylesheets _or_ contain all css styles. The Theme screen.css is always loaded
 * after the site's layout stylesheets which means that Themes can modify the
 * layout using cascading. However please note there are two stylesheets, one
 * called ie.css and another ie6.css which are loaded after Themes which define
 * fixes for Internet Explorer browsers.
 * Images and fonts should be loaded relative to the directory that contains this
 * file.

/* uncomment the following example to import other stylesheets from the same directory */
