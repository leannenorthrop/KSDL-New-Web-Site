The many meditation classes and more specialised courses are offered at low cost and the use of the shrine room for personal practice as well as group meditation is free of charge. With regular meditations and prayers, the activities of the centres are dedicated to peace, harmony and happines in the world.';'Manor Place';'The shrine room is available to visitors to come and meditate when the Centre is open, providing a place of peace and quiet in the midst of the otherwise busy city. There are also regular meditations, prayer and teaching sessions at 7pm in the evening.\r\n\r\nDecorated in traditional Tibetan colours, the warm and peaceful environment of the shrine room is enjoyed by all who visit.\r\n\r\nThe library houses a selection of books which are primarily on Tibetan Buddhism. Visitors are welcome to sit and read at the Centre, however we regret that this is not a lending library.\r\n'

For the foreseeable future 33 Manor Place will remain open. Meanwhile work is underway at 15 Spa Road. What will this new building bring to London? We hope everyone will find something helpful in our new diverse Centre.\r\n\r\nLearn to meditate\r\nFor those wanting to learn and practice meditation there will be two beautiful meditation halls decorated in the Tibetan style. Weekly classes led by experienced teachers will introduce the basic principles of meditation and help to get you started. Each week you can come and meditate at the Centre either when the meditation halls are not being used, or during one of our regular group meditation sessions.\r\n\r\nPractice Buddhism\r\nEach month traditional Buddhist practices for well being, health and world peace are completed by the resident ordained and lay community. You can join in with these prayers and group meditations. Texts are available in the shop and courses explaining the practices occur regularly throughout the year.';'Spa Road';'Find peace and well being\r\nWe will once again create a tea room. The tea room has been greatly missed by regular users of the Centre since our departure from the Carlisle Lane Centre, but in Spa Road there will be a space to relax with friends. Spend time in the Tea room winding down before a therapy treatment or meditation class.\r\n\r\nHealth treatments\r\nMany people rely on the Centre to provide quality health treatments. We will hold monthly clinics by a Tibetan doctor, who uses traditional Tibetan methods and medicines to treat a wide variety of ailments. At Spa Road we have a suite of treatment rooms, and larger spaces for group activities such as Pregnancy Yoga, Martial Arts, and psychotherapy courses, conferences and much more. The Centre will provide the space for a weekly Community Clinic which will offer many alternative treatments by professional practitioners at a low cost. Treatments such as Acupuncture, Cranio Sacral, Homeopathey, Reflexology, Shiastsu, Indian Head Massage and much more will be available weekly during the daytime.\r\n\r\nVolunteer at the Centre\r\nKagyu Samye Dzong London is run by volunteers. Volunteering at the Centre is a great way to get to know the Centre better and become a part of the community. You may have particular skills that youâ€™d like to offer, or maybe you can commit to a rota and help in the shop or office each week. The Centre is always on the look out for cooks, and there is the never ending job of keeping the building clean and tidy. Look out for our volunteer days at 15 Spa Road and join in.'
