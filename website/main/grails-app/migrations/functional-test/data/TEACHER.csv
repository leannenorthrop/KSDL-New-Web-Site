3,Five line summary on Lama Rinpoche.,8,"p. Born in 1943 in Kham‚ East Tibet‚ Lama Yeshe spent his formative years in education at Dolma Lhakang Monastery where his brother‚ Akong Tulku Rinpoche‚ was Abbot. After a harrowing six month journey escaping from Tibet as a teenager in 1959‚ Lama Yeshe arrived in India along with Akong Rinpoche‚ Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche and a handful of other exhausted refugees. On leaving the Tibetan Refugee Camp he attended the Young Lamas Home School in Dalhousie and left in 1967 to serve as Private Secretary to His Holiness the 16th Gyalwa Karmapa at Rumtek Monastery in Sikkim. \n \np. In 1969 Lama Yeshe joined Akong Tulku Rinpoche and Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche in Scotland where they had founded Kagyu Samye Ling‚ the first Tibetan Buddhist Monastery in Europe‚ Five years later‚ having tasted and become disillusioned with modern Western culture‚ from the trappings of materialism to the false highs of sixties hippydom‚ he was reunited with H.H. Karmapa and accompanied him on a tour of the United States. At His Holiness's request Lama Yeshe and his friend Lama Tenzin Chonyi established and managed the Karma Triyana Dharmacakra Centre in Woodstock New York which is now H.H. Karmapa's main seat in the U.S. \n \np. In 1980 he took full ordination as a Gelong monk from His Holiness Karmapa‚ on the auspicious date of the anniversary of Lord Buddha's Nirvana and Parinirvana‚ at a ceremony attended by the most eminent Tibetan Lamas of the time. Following his ordination Lama Yeshe entered a strict‚ long-term solitary retreat under the guidance of the Abbot of Karma Triyana‚ Khenpo Karthar Rinpoche. Lama Yeshe Losal also received teachings from many of the highest Kagyu Lamas‚ including extensive instruction and initiations from his root guru H.H. the 16th Karmapa‚ and from The 12th Tai Situpa‚ Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche‚ Gyaltsap Rinpoche‚ and the Very Venerable Kalu Rinpoche. \n \np. He later received specialised teachings from Tulku Urgyen who supervised Lama Yeshe's 49 day Bardo retreat of total solitude and darkness in Nepal. In 1997 Lama Yeshe was able to complete a second 49 day Bardo retreat on Holy Island in a specially built retreat-master's cabin. This rare accomplishment has made him one of the foremost meditation Masters alive today‚ about whom His Holiness the 17th Karmapa recently said‚ "If you want to know about meditation‚ look no further than Lama Yeshe Losal." \n \np. In 1985‚ at the request of his brother Akong Tulku Rinpoche‚ Lama Yeshe returned to Scotland to continue his retreat at Samye Ling Purelands Retreat Centre and in 1989 became Retreat Master with responsibility for the western practitioners in the cloistered four year retreat. Despite his heartfelt wish to remain in retreat for twenty years‚ Lama Yeshe was obliged to return to the world in 1991 to take responsibility for the running of Samye Ling and also to oversee the newly acquired The Holy Island Project. \n \np. After a vigorous fundraising effort the small but imposing island off Scotland's West Coast was acquired in 1992 to fulfill Lama Yeshe's dream of establishing a long-term Buddhist Retreat at one end and an interfaith Centre for World Peace and Health at the other. The beautiful island was home to rare breeds of Eriskay ponies‚ Soay sheep and Sanaan goats and has since become a haven‚ not only for wildlife but also for the many visitors who come on pilgrimage to its sacred sites‚ or to enjoy a wide range of retreats and courses. Under Lama Yeshe's guidance‚ and with the help from supporters around the globe‚ Holy Island has become a model of environmentally-friendly living where humans and animals live in peace and harmony. \n \np. The new Centre‚ with its tasteful accommodation and spacious Peace Hall‚ was opened to the public in May 2003 and now hosts regular courses‚ interfaith conferences and retreats while‚ at the south end of the island‚ the original light-house cottages have been beautifully renovated to create a long-term retreat house for women. The first traditional Buddhist three-year‚ three-month retreat on Holy Island was successfully completed in March 2006 by a multinational group of women from eight different countries. \n \np. Under Lama Yeshe's direction Samye Ling continues to flourish and is now is home to an increasing number of resident ordained Sangha and lay practitioners. The Centre attracts thousands of visitors who come to enjoy the magnificent temple and grounds or to attend one of the many courses on offer. In recognition of his achievements at home and abroad the title of 'Abbot' was conferred upon Lama Yeshe in 1995. One of his first actions as Abbot was to establish the Samye Sangha Foundation to help the monks and nuns become self-supporting. \n \np. Lama Yeshe Losal also travels extensively‚ giving teachings at many associated Samye Dzong branches around the world and participating in numerous interfaith events at the highest level. In November 1998 he received the 'Sasana Kirthi Sri' award at the International Sarvodaya Bhikku Congress in Sri Lanka and is the first Tibetan Lama to make such a connection with the Theravadin community and receive this high honour. Furthermore he was invited to tour the Buddhist sacred sites of Burma by Dr Rewatadhamma followed by a pilgrimage to the Thai Buddhist holy places hosted by Ajahn Sumedho. In the same year Lama Yeshe became the first Tibetan Buddhist Lama to act as preceptor in a multi-national ceremony bestowing full ordination to over a hundred women‚ including a group of eleven nuns from Samye Ling. \n \np. His charismatic presence and good humour give Lama Yeshe the ability to connect with people from all walks of life making him much in demand as a guest speaker at many high profile events such as the prestigious Shell International Conference at Maastricht where he was invited to speak to the top six hundred managers in 1999. A year later he attended a week long conference of the Global Business Network in Sonoma USA‚ where he addressed leading CEOs from many of the world's multi-national companies on the benefits of meditation. \n \np. In August 2003‚ on the occasion of his 60th birthday celebration‚ Lama Yeshe was awarded the title "Rinpoche" in honour of his commitment to establishing a strong ordained Sangha in the West‚ and in recognition of his achievements as Abbot and his inspiring example to many thousands of friends and students around the world. \n \np. His participation in inter-faith dialogue at home and abroad continues apace. On Holy Island in August 2003‚ he hosted a visit of the Religious Leaders of Scotland and has forged lasting friendships with several of his fellow faith leaders. In February 2002‚ he attended the European Parliament in Brussels as the guest of the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. Later that year‚ during the celebration of Her Majesty the Queen's Golden Jubilee‚ he was invited to a reception at Buckingham Palace where he met members of the Royal family and presented Her Majesty the Queen with a traditional silk scarf and Tibetan thanka. \n \np. Lama Yeshe Rinpoche's current focus at Samye Ling is to build the final phase of the Samye Project by completing the educational wing which will house the Samye College‚ Museum and Libraries. As Chairman of Rokpa Trust Lama Yeshe Losal Rinpoche has responsibility for Kagyu Samye Ling‚ The Holy Island Project and Kagyu Samye Dzong Centres worldwide. He is also involved in the Trust's charitable projects both at home and overseas. His energy and inspiration fuel the Trusts far reaching activities which benefit so many people in so many ways. Indeed‚ he is a living example of the joyful Bodhisattva in action. \n \np. Publications include "Living Dharma"‚ also published in French‚ German‚ Finnish and Spanish.

4,5 line summary on Rinpoche.,7,"p. Born in 1939‚ near Riwoche in Kham‚ Eastern Tibet‚ he was discovered at a very young age by the search party seeking the reincarnation of the previous (1st) Akong‚ Abbot of Dolma Lhakang monastery near Chakdado‚ in the Chamdo area of Kham. The search party was following precise instructions given by HH the 16th Gyalwa Karmapa‚ Supreme Head of the Karma Kamtsang tradition. \n \np. Around the age of four‚ the child was taken to Dolma Lhakang to receive the spiritual and formal education necessary for him to be able resume his work as Abbot later on. Dolma Lhakang was a monastery with some 100 monks and many associated small retreats and nunneries. Besides his religious studies‚ the young Akong Tulku also trained in traditional Tibetan medicine. \n \np. As a teenager‚ he travelled from community to community‚ performing religious ceremonies and treating the sick. He then went to the great monastic university of Secchen‚ where he received transmission of the quintessential mahamudra Kagyu Buddhist lineage from Secchen Kongtrul Rinpoche. His spiritual training as a holder of the Kagyu lineage was further completed under the guidance of HH the 16th Gyalwa Karmapa ‚ who also certified him as a teacher of Tibetan medicine. Rinpoche also holds many lineages of the Nyingmapa tradition. \nThroughout this period he was treated with much reverence and respect. \n \np. The 1959 takeover of Tibet caused him to flee to India‚ in an arduous‚ nine month journey as one of the leaders of a 300-strong party‚ of which only some 13 persons made it to safety in India. At one point‚ they were so hungry that they were obliged to boil the leather of their bags or boots to make soup. After spending sme time in refugee camps‚ he was asked‚ along with some other lamas‚ to look after yhe Young Lamas Home School‚ in Dalhousie‚ NW India. This was a place where young reincarnate lamas from all traditions of Tibetan Buddhism could receive an education. \n \np. Through the kind help of Mrs Freda Bedi‚ later to become Sister Palmo‚ he and Trungpa Tulku‚ Abbot of Surmang‚ sailed to England in 1963‚ to learn English in Oxford. Only the latter had a bursary and Akong Tulku worked for some years as a simple hospital orderly‚ supporting himself‚ Trungpa Rinpoche and Tulku Chime of Benchen Monastery in the small appartment they shared. \n \np. The next 25 years (1963-1988) were spent introducing the West to Tibetan religion and some aspects of its culture. This served a double purpose: it began to make available to the world at large a wealth of material from one of Asia's finest and most extraordinary civilisations. \n \np. By so doing‚ it also ensured its survival and perpetuation as a living tradition. This work was centred around the development of the Kagyu Samye Ling Monastery and Tibetan Centre‚ in Scotland; the first Tibetan Buddhist Centre in the West‚ developed jointly by Dr Akong Tulku Rinpoche and Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche in its first few years and thereafter by Akong Tulku. Visited by people from all over the world‚ he made it first and foremost a place of peace and spirituality‚ with a strong accent on active‚ selfless compassion‚ open to anyone of any faith. \nIn response to a growing demand for specific teachings from the Kagyu traditions‚ he invited its greatest living scholars and meditation masters to Scotland‚ where they taught its main meditation practices and philosophical texts. The ground was laid for the proper development of these teachings in the West when the Supreme Head of the Kagyu Lineage‚ HH the 16th Gyalwa Karmapa visited Samye Ling in 1975 and 1977. Akong Tulku was then asked by the Karmapa to be the organisor of his 1977 6-month tour of Europe. \n \np. Under the Gyalwa Karmapa's guidance‚ Akong Tulku established a traditional 3-year meditation retreat at Samye Ling and launched the construction of the Samye Project; the building of a major traditional Tibetan Buddhist temple and an accompanying College‚ Library and Museum. Phase 1 of Samye Project consists of the temple‚ built entirely by members of the Samye Ling community‚ under the active leadership of Akong Tulku‚ who was often to be seen with a trowel in hand on the building site. The inside of the temple was exquisitely finished by a team of fine artists‚ sculptors‚ woodcarvers and other craftspeople working under the guidance of Sherapalden Beru. Sherapalden is one of the‚ if not the‚ finest master-artists of the Karma Gadri tradition. \n \np. The grand opening of Samye Temple took place on the 8th August 1988‚ with a commemorative plaque being unveiled by the XIIth Tai Situpa and the Rt. Hon. David Steel MP (now Lord Steel). Senior representatives of the world's religions attended. During this period of Samye Ling's development‚ various satellite centres and activities had come into being. Samye Dzong centres grew up in Belgium‚ Spain‚ Ireland‚ South Africa‚ Zimbabwe and the UK. On another front‚ the interest which many therapists and physicians showed in Akong Tulku's medicinal and therapeutic Buddhist skills led to the development of a unique therapy system‚ now thriving as the Tara Rokpa Therapy. \n \np. Akong Tulku's main activity in the 1990s concerned the expansion of his humanitarian activities‚ principally in Tibet and Nepal‚ but also in Europe‚ where he created several soup kitchens to feed the homeless in major cities. With tremendous vigour and diligence‚ he has brought well over 100 projects into existence in Tibet‚ each project being a school‚ clinic‚ medical college‚ self-help programme or scheme to save the Tibetan environment. These are mainly located in isolated rural areas of the Eastern part of the Tibetan plateau. \n \np. In Nepal‚ working mainly through Rokpa International's Vice President Lea Wyler‚ Rinpoche has established an important project which feeds the hungry through the winter months. This has expanded to incorporate a children's home‚ clinic‚ womens' self-help workshops and so forth. \n \np. In 1992‚ Akong Tulku was one of the main people to discover the reincarnation of the 16th Gyalwa Karmapa and he played a very important role in first finding him‚ then taking him to the Karmapa seat at Tolung Tsurpu monastery and later arranging the visit of the two Regents - the 12th Tai Situpa and the 9th Goshir Gyatsabpa - who gave him the naming ceremony and later enthroned him formally as the 17th Gyalwa Karmapa‚ Urgyen Drodul Tinley Dorje. \n \np. The increasing burden of his work in Tibet led Akong Tulku to request his brother‚ the Ven Lama Yeshe Losal Rinpoche‚ to take over the running of Kagyu Samye Ling in Scotland. Lama Rinpoche became the new Abbot and has since proved very successful‚ particularly in founding a strong monastic community there.",R,null,Choje Akong Tulku
5,5 line summary ,0,"p. Lama Gelongma Zangmo first became a practising Buddhist when she arrived at Kagyu Samye Ling in 1977 and took refuge with his Holiness the 16th Karmapa. Having received teachings from many highly respected lamas who visited Kagyu Samye Ling‚ she was inspired to enter the four-year closed retreat in 1984‚ during which time she became ordained as a Buddhist nun. \n \np. When the next long retreat started in 1989 Lama Zangmo wished to further her retreat experience and she was also asked to help and advise the new retreatants. Having completed that retreat in 1993‚ Lama Zangmo then entered a third long retreat and became the resident retreat teacher to the other women retreatants. That retreat ended in 1997‚ bringing the total number of years Lama Zangmo spent in retreat to eleven and a half. \n \np. Choje Akong Tulku Rinpoche and Lama Yeshe Losal then asked Lama Zangmo to put her experience to good use by helping to run the Kagyu Samye Dzong Centre in London‚ which was officially opened in 1998. Since then the London Centre has flourished under Lama Zangmo's guidance and established itself as a much needed Dharma Centre in the capital city‚ providing a full and varied programme of teachings and events throughout the year. \n \np. In 1998 Lama Zangmo was one of a group of nuns who accompanied Lama Yeshe Losal to India‚ where she became fully ordained as a Gelongma (Bhikkuni) at a historic ceremony in Bodhgaya. This will in turn enable others to take full Gelongma ordination with the Tibetan Buddhist tradition in the future. \n \np. Lama Zangmo's strong connection with Kagyu lineage and in particular with Choje Akong Tulku Rinpoche and Lama Yeshe Losal has inspired her to work tirelessly and joyfully in service to the Dharma and helping others. In recognition of her long experience‚ selfless qualities and commitment‚ she became the first person in the UK to be honoured with the title of Lama by our organisation at a heart warming ceremony in Kagyu Samye Dzong London in June 2001.",L,null,Zangmo
